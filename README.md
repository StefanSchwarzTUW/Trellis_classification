# Trellis_classification
Trellis classification of points on complex-valued Grassmann manifolds

This code can be used to reproduce results of 

"Codebook Training for Trellis-Based Hierarchical Grassmannian Classification", IEEE Wireless Communications Letter, S. Schwarz and T. Tsiftsis, 2022

The first main file is CSI_Net_training_main.m, which is for Grassmannian quantization codebook training.
The second main file is NC_CB_learning_main_v3.m, which is for non-coherent transmission codebook training.

The scripts should be run on Matlab R2020b or above, as they require "pagemtimes".
