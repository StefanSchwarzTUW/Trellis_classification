This code can be used to reproduce results of 

"Codebook Training for Trellis-Based Hierarchical Grassmannian Classification", IEEE Wireless Communications Letter, S. Schwarz and T. Tsiftsis

The main file is CSI_Net_training_main.m

The scripts should be run on Matlab R2020b or above, as they require "pagemtimes".
